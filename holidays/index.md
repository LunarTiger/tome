<h1>Holidays</h1>

<section><h3>Lupercalia — February 15</h3>
  <p>Celebration of bodily autonomy, sexual liberation, and reproduction.</p>
  <p>Based on the Roman festival of the same name. In keeping with ancient tradition, February 13th &amp; 14th are observed as feast days leading up to the actual holiday. What we are translating this to in TST is a "hail yourself" day. This idea offers a parallel to "others-centered" traditions of Sol Invictus.</p>

<section><h3>Hexennacht — April 30</h3>
  <p>Occasion honouring those who fell victim to superstition and pseudoscience, whether by witch hunt, Satanic panic, or other injustices.</p>
  <p>In Johann Wolfgang von Gothe's Faustia Tragedy (1808), Mephisto &amp; Faust attended the Walpurgisnacht revelry atop Mount Brocken. TST's Hexennacht is a solemn holiday to honour those who were victimised by superstition.</p>

<section><h3>Unveiling Day — July 25</h3>
  <p>Celebration of religious plurality and shedding archaic superstition.</p>
  <p>A centerpiece of our religious movement and iconic of modern Satanism, the Baphomet with Children statue was commissioned by TST in 2014 &amp; created by Mark Porter with "respect for diversity and religious minorities" in mind. On July 25, 2015, TST unveiled Baphomet to a large crowd of devotees in Detroit, signaling the beginning of the new Satanic era. We observe this milestone in Satanic history by celebrating Unveiling Day.</p>

<section><h3>Halloween — October 31</h3>
  <p>Holiday to celebrate indulgence &amp; embrace the darkness &amp; its aesthetic.</p>
  <p>Halloween is consistently described as evil, demonic, &amp; satanic by those steeped in religious dogma. Costumes, candy, &amp; facing fears are to be embraced.</p>
</section>

<section><h3>Sol Invictus — December 25</h3>
  <p>Celebration of being unconquered by superstition &amp; consistent in the persuit &amp; sharing of knowledge.</p>
  <p>The cult of Sol existed in Rome since its early days as a republic, and Invictus was an epithet used for Jupiter, Mars, &amp; Apollo (among others). The festival celebrated these gods and have also been used to celebrate the winter solstice.</p>
