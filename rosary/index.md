<section><h3>The Luciferian Impulse</h3>
  <p>I embrace the Luciferian impulse<br/>To eat of the tree of knoledge,<br/>To stand unfettered by doctrines of fear,<br/>To practice justice instead of panic,<br/>To reason with openness and evidence,<br/>To resist threats to personal sovereignty, and <br/>To dissipate my delusions.<br/>That which will not bend must brake, and<br/>That which can be destroyed by truth should never be spared its demise.<br/>Hail Satan</p>

<section><h3>Hail Myself</h3>
  <p>Let us not conquer the heavens.<br/>God, conquered, will become Satan;<br/>Satan, conquering, will become God.<br/>May the fates spare us this terrible lot.<br/>Unmake and make.<br/>Hail myself, hail others, hail Satan</p>

<section><h3>The 7 Tenets of The Satanic Temple</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.</li>
    <li>The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.</li>
    <li>One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.</li>
    <li>The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.</li>
    <li>Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.</li>
    <li>People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.</li>
    <li>Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.</li>
  </ol>
