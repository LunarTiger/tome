<h1>Sins</h1>

<ul>
  <li>To not exercise your free will.</li>
  <li>To suppress the free will of another.</li>
  <li>To mistake delusions for reality.</li>
  <li>To not make use of life's learning opportunities.</li>
  <li>To not seek out learning opportunities everywhere.</li>
  <li>To not be an authentic human being, but one thoughtlessly modeled to culturally conditioned thinking and norms.</li>
  <li>To be embarrassed or vulgar of the wondrous creation of Nature such as the mind, body, &amp; soul and their functions.</li>
  <li>To create or submit to a brainwashing environment where your mind &amp; soul is repeatedly bombarded with nonsensical messages, music, noise, &amp; commercial instructions.</li>
  <li>To neglect your duties as an elder or guide &amp; care for the children in the community's minds, hearts, bodies, &amp; souls.</li>
  <li>To neglect your duties as a child to learn from &amp; seek the guidance of elders.</li>
  <li>To cause more harm than you already do. Humans cause harm all the time because of what we eat, our footprint on the planet, &amp; our sometimes harmful nature. We must become more conscious of this and try to do less harm.</li>
  <li>To waste resources is to be inconsiderate of the suffering of others and the planet. To consume more than required to maintain the body, to use more fuel than required to stay healthy, to demand goods that are wastfully packaged &amp; to consume foods that are nothing more than empty calories are all part of a vulgar and greedy lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
